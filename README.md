Version: v.1.0.0

[Nyma live](https://nyma-game.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

Nyma is a Zuma game clone developed from scratch as a part of [Middle Front End Developer course by Yandex Practicum](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/middle-frontend/).

It is a classic tile-matching puzzle video-game. The goal of Nyma is to eliminate all of the balls rolling around the screen along a given path before these balls reach the skull structure. The player can eliminate the balls by firing a colored ball from the stone frog's mouth towards the chain of balls. When three or more of the same color come in contact, they explode, possibly triggering other explosions as part of a chain reaction. The color of the ball to fire is visible in the frog's mouth, and also the next coming ball is visible in the frog's head.

At the end of the game the total amount of points is calculated and displayed to the user. The user can also view the Leaderboard page to see their rank among other players.
